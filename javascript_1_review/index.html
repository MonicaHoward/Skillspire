* Create a webpage that asks the user where they are from.

  * If you have been there before create an alert that says "I've been to <cityName> before"

  * If you haven't been to that city, create an alert that says "I've never visited <cityName>"


    *** <cityName> should be replaced by the actual city that the person is from.
